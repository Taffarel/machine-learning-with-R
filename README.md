# Modeling the strength of concrete with ANNs

In the field of engineering, it is crucial to have accurate estimates of the performance
of building materials. These estimates are required in order to develop safety
guidelines governing the materials used in the construction of buildings, bridges,
and roadways.
Estimating the strength of concrete is a challenge of particular interest. Although it is
used in nearly every construction project, concrete performance varies greatly due to
the use of a wide variety of ingredients that interact in complex ways. As a result, it
is difficult to accurately predict the strength of the final product. A model that could
reliably predict concrete strength given a listing of the composition of the input
materials could result in safer construction practices.


For this analysis, we will utilize data on the compressive strength of concrete donated
to the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository ( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml )
by I-Cheng Yeh. As he found success using neural networks to model these data, we
will attempt to replicate Yeh's work using a simple neural network model in R.


For more information on Yeh's approach to this learning task,

artificial neural networks, Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 28,
pp. 1797-1808, by I-C Yeh (1998).
